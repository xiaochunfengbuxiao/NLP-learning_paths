Title :     A   Signal   Processing   Approach   to   Fast   Magnetic   Resonance   Imaging   ( MRI )
Abstract :   Magnetic   resonance   imaging   ( MRI )   has   become   an   important   imaging   modality   for   clinical   diagnosis   and   scientific   research .   However ,   MRI   is   still   a   relatively   slow   technique .   State - of - the - art   technology   is   capable   of   acquiring   3D   images   from   static   objects   and   2D   images   from   time - varying   objects .   It   is   desirable ,   for   a   number   of   applications ,   to   develop   " real - time "   imaging   capability .   In   this   presentation ,   I   will   discuss   a   signal   processing   approach   to   fast   imaging   based   on   parallel   data   acquisition   and   generalized   series   reconstruction .   I   shall   describe   the   associated   data   acquisition   scheme   and   image   reconstruction   algorithm ,   and   show   some   examples   to   demonstrate   the   capabilities   of   the   new   approach .   In   addition ,   I   will   give   a   brief   introduction   to   the   graduate   education   at   the   Electrical   Engineering   Department   at   Texas   A & amp ; M   University ,
Biosketch :
Jim   Xiuquan   Ji   received   his   Bachelor   degree   and   Master   degree   in   Electrical   Engineering   from   Tsinghua   University   in   1993   and   1997 ,   respectively .   He   then   moved   to   the   US   and   started   his   PhD   study   at   Beckman   Institute   at   University   of   Illinois   at   Urbana - Champaign   ( UIUC ) .     In   2001 ,   he   was   awarded   the   Sundaram   Seshu   Fellowship ,   an   award   given   to   one   or   two   " academically   outstanding   students "   in   the   ECE   department   of   UIUC   each   year .     Since   2003 ,   he   has   been   an   Assistant   Professor   at   Electrical   Engineering   Department ,   Dwight   Look   College   of   Engineering ,   Texas   A & amp ; M   University .   His   research   interests   include   high - speed   Magnetic   Resonance   Imaging   ( MRI )   and   biomedical   signal   and   image   processing .   He   is   a   member   of   the   Phi   Kappa   Phi   National   Honor   Society ,   IEEE   Engineering   in   Medicine   and   Biology ,   and   International   Society   of   Magnetic   Resonance   in   Medicine .
