you   can   only   give   your   advice ,   you   can   not   make   decision   for   her   even   she   is   going   down   to   the   wrong   way .
She   will   come   back   when   she   realize   it   was   a   wrong   decision ,   and   she   would   appreciate   that   you   were   trying   to   help   her .
But   if   you   keep   arguing   with   her   and   trying   to   manipulate   her ,   no   doubt   not   only   she   will   not   follow   your   way   ,   even   worse   she   will   find   you   more   annoying   and   she   will   start   to   keep   away   from   you .
just   let   her   go   and   support   whatever   she   wants   to   do   if   you   really   like   her .
well   unless   you   are   just   being   selfish   and   want   her   to   be   with   you .
