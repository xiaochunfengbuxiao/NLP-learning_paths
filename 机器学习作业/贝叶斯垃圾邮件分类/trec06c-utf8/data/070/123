   幽默篇

   Sitting by the window of her room, Sister Janice opened a letter
   from home one evening. Inside the letter was a $100 bill her parents
   had sent. Sister Janice smiled. As she read the letter by the window,
   she noticed a poorly-dressed stranger leaning against the street lamp
   below.
   Quickly, she wrote: "Don't despair. - Sister Janice" on a piece of
   paper, wrapped the $100 bill in it, got the man's attention, and
   tossed it out the window to him. The stranger picked it up, and with a
   puzzled look, he bowed and went off down the street.

   The next day, Sister Janice was told that a man was at her door,
   insisting upon seeing her. She went down, and found the poorly-dressed
   stranger waiting. Without a single word, he handed her a huge wad
   (一叠) of $100 bills.
   "What is this, Sir?" she asked.
   "That is the $8,000 you have coming, Sister Janice," he replied.
   "Don't Despair paid 80-to-1."

   脑筋急转弯

   Jim bet Mr. Smith, the owner of a glassware store, $500 that he
   could throw one of his glasses into a recycle bin 100 meters away
   without breaking it. Mr. Smith agreed because he knew that Jim is
   neither a lunatic or Superman.
   Taking careful aim, Jim threw the glass right into -- the wall
   standing behind the recycle bin, and broke the glass. Mr. Smith smiled
   as he accepted the money from Jim. But, stepping out of the store, Jim
   was grinning the biggest smile a person would ever see. Why?
