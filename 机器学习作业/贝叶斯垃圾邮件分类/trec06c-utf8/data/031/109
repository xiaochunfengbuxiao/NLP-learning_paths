Title:  A Signal Processing Approach to Fast Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI)
Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become an important imaging modality for clinical diagnosis and scientific research. However, MRI is still a relatively slow technique. State-of-the-art technology is capable of acquiring 3D images from static objects and 2D images from time-varying objects. It is desirable, for a number of applications, to develop "real-time" imaging capability. In this presentation, I will discuss a signal processing approach to fast imaging based on parallel data acquisition and generalized series reconstruction. I shall describe the associated data acquisition scheme and image reconstruction algorithm, and show some examples to demonstrate the capabilities of the new approach. In addition, I will give a brief introduction to the graduate education at the Electrical Engineering Department at Texas A&amp;M University,
Biosketch: 
Jim Xiuquan Ji received his Bachelor degree and Master degree in Electrical Engineering from Tsinghua University in 1993 and 1997, respectively. He then moved to the US and started his PhD study at Beckman Institute at University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC).  In 2001, he was awarded the Sundaram Seshu Fellowship, an award given to one or two "academically outstanding students" in the ECE department of UIUC each year.  Since 2003, he has been an Assistant Professor at Electrical Engineering Department, Dwight Look College of Engineering, Texas A&amp;M University. His research interests include high-speed Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and biomedical signal and image processing. He is a member of the Phi Kappa Phi National Honor Society, IEEE Engineering in Medicine and Biology, and International Society of Magnetic Resonance in Medicine.
