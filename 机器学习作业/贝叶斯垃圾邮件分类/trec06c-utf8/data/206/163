TAAG sadly announces the passing away of YUAN Xiaodong and his mother Ms. WANG
 Zhaohui. The car found down the valley at the dangerous road right outside of
 the east gate of Yosemite National Park has their bodies inside. Yan, Baoshan
, and June already arrived at the scene.
20分钟前的消息.
      大家以后开车小心点。
